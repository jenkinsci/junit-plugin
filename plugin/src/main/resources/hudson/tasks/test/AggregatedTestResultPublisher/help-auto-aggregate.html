    When checked, Jenkins simply aggregates tests from
    all the transitive downstream jobs of this project. This is convenient
    as you don't have to individually list them and keep them up to date
    as you add/remove jobs. This normally works just fine, as your test
    jobs are normally set up as downstream jobs of the build job.

    <p>
    If for some reasons the auto aggregation doesn't work, you can always
    manually specify a list of jobs to be aggregated.
