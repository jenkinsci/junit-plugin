<div>
    If checked, the default behavior of failing a build on missing test result files
    or empty test results is changed to not affect the status of the build.
    Please note that this setting make it harder to spot misconfigured jobs or
    build failures where the test tool does not exit with an error code when
    not producing test report files.
