    If checked, any standard output or error from a test suite will be retained
    in the test results after the build completes. (This refers only to additional
    messages printed to console, not to a failure stack trace.) Such output is
    always kept if the test failed, but by default lengthy output from passing
    tests is truncated to save space. Check this option if you need to see every
    log message from even passing tests, but beware that Jenkins's memory consumption
    can substantially increase as a result, even if you never look at the test results!
