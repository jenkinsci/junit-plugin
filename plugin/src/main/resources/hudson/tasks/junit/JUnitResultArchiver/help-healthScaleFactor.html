<div>
    The amplification factor to apply to test failures when computing the test result contribution to the build health
    score.
    <br />
    The default factor is <code>1.0</code>
    <ul>
        <li>A factor of <code>0.0</code> will disable the test result contribution to build health score.</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>0.1</code> means that 10% of tests failing will score 99% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>0.5</code> means that 10% of tests failing will score 95% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>1.0</code> means that 10% of tests failing will score 90% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>2.0</code> means that 10% of tests failing will score 80% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>2.5</code> means that 10% of tests failing will score 75% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>5.0</code> means that 10% of tests failing will score 50% health</li>
        <li>A factor of <code>10.0</code> means that 10% of tests failing will score 0% health</li>
    </ul>
    The factor is persisted with the build results, so changes will only be reflected in new builds.
