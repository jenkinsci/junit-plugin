<div>
    Controls how standard output or error from a test suite will be retained
    in the test results after the build completes. (This refers only to additional
    messages printed to console, not to a failure stack trace.) Some output is
    always retained for tests, but by default, excessively long output is truncated
    to save disk space. This property can be used to control whether that truncation
    takes place:
    <ul>
        <li>If set to 'all', then no truncation will take place and the complete output from
        every test will be stored.</li>
        <li>If set to 'failed', then the complete output from all failed tests will be stored,
        but long output from passing tests will be truncated.</li>
        <li>If set to 'none', then long output from every test will be truncated, regardless
        of whether they passed or failed.</li>
    </ul>
    Beware that storing large output can cause Jenkins's memory consumption to
    substantially increase, even if you never look at the test results.
